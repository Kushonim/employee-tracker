# staff-synopsis
## Description
An example application utilizing postgres psql and inquirer to create, read, update, and delete from a database. Given the prompts, the user can easily navigate and manipulate a realistic example of a company's employee database. I worked on this to get familiar with using postgres and CRUD operations.

## Installation
You can access the application through the deployed URL:

## Usage
After installing the necessary npms and running the app.js file using node, the user will be given a selection of functions to edit the database per the user's needs.
